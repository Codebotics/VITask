# VITask

_Currently in Public Beta. Checkout our [Downloads](https://vitask.me/downloads) Page for downloading_ 

VITask is the solution for problems VITCC students face daily. VITask is complete environment solution containing Desktop, Mobile and WebApp. 

VITask is a public API server. We believe in collaborative software development. We have carefully curated each piece of our apps. 

## Who are we?

We are a group of students who have come together to provide a different and unique experience to our VITCC community. Our students have great knowledge for developing various apps but still we lacked college centered app.

So a bunch of students decided to come together and develop an experience as best as we can. We are just like you who hate to type captcha everytime we want to check our attendance. It is a simple contribution to beautiful VITCC Community.

## That's cool, I want to contribute

Although we usually test our apps before deployment but there are still many bugs we don't know about or exceed our capability to fix.

If you want to contribute, you may start by solving any Issues and submitting a Pull Request. Make sure you follow our [Contributing guidelines](Contributing.md). We would be happy to merge your pull request if it fixes a bug or implements a new feature. 

## I have feature request

We want to provide a complete solution to the problems students face. So, if you have any idea you would love to see in our app, submit an Issue with tag `Feature Request`. If it sounds too much work, you can always DM us on instagram `@vitask.me` 


## Something isn't right

There may be bugs in our app, we are only humans. We like to provide you a streamlined experience. You can report a bug by opening an Issue with tag `Bug` or DM us on instagram `@vitask.me`. Make sure to include screenshot of the bug and steps on creating that bug.
